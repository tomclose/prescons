{"body":"# prescons.py\r\n\r\nThis is a \"pseudo-interactive\" python interpreter.  I hacked this together\r\nwhen preparing a presentation that involved some live coding.  It reads code\r\nfrom an input file and runs it line by line.  You can move through the code by\r\nhitting 'space'.\r\n\r\nYou can also switch to (and from) a normal interactive console by pressing\r\nCtrl-C.  This allows you to inspect, and even make changes to, the console's\r\nnamespace in the middle of a presentation.\r\n\r\nSuggestions, bug reports, patches welcome at github.com/inglesp/prescons.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n $ python prescons.py <filename>\r\n\r\nSee example.py for an example.\r\n\r\nTested on Posix and Windows, and with pythons 2.7 and 3.2\r\n\r\nThanks to Asim Ihsan (https://github.com/asimihsan/) for testing and ideas.","note":"Don't delete this file!
